# renovate-config

**Outdated** switching back to Mend's Saas Renovate (one thing less to maintain...)

Self-hosted renovate in Github Actions

## Setup

Almost all is documented here: https://github.com/renovatebot/github-action

The app has been created manually and installed to all repos in my account. Thus renovate will autodiscover all repos in this account that contain a valid `renovate.json` config.

### Config

All options can be found here: https://docs.renovatebot.com/self-hosted-configuration/#allowplugins
